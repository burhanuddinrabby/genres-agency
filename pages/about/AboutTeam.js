                    It&apos;s dusk, so dark. <br />

                    A traveler wants to meet Chanakya, he came from far. <br />

                    He enters Chanakya&apos;s home. <br />

                    Chanakya is working on a few papers under the oil lamp (old times!). He welcomes him smiling, and asks to sit. He then hurries his work, turns off the lamp, lights another. <br />

                    This was strange. And if you are like me or the traveler, you would be tensed to learn why he did this. <br />

                    So the traveler could no longer control: <span className='font-semibold'>&quot;Is this an Indian custom?&quot;</span><br />

                    - <span className='font-semibold'>&quot;Which one?&quot;</span><br />

                    : <span className='font-semibold'>&quot;To light up another lamp when a guest visits!?&quot;</span><br />

                    - <span className='font-semibold'>&quot;No, my dear friend. There is no such custom. I was doing my nation&apos;s official work when you entered and the lamp&apos;s oil was from National treasure&apos;s money. Now I&apos;m talking with you, it&apos;s a personal and friendly conversation, so I&apos;m using oil purchased from personal money.&quot;</span><br />

                Agency means being in the state of action. When you are a new startup, either you have massive funds (from investors or bootstrapped) or you have zero.<br />

                And you may or may not have resources or talents.<br />

                But you want agency (quick actions). Only actions generate results, you know it.

                So it&apos;s tempting to try to find the best of talents spending long delays and big-bucksâ€•especially the money we get for free (perceptually-free: you still have to return profits to investors) or time that we take for granted.

                Also it&apos;s a little challenging to find talents who are willing to work in a brand new startup.

                And a Digital Agency can help you here. Agency is a business that accumulates talents, skills, insider-knowledge and makes it cost-effective for others to use.

                We tried to be a startup first, we lingered for a year and two months, couldn&apos;t survive, so quit for some time.

                This means we understand your pains. So we can help you best.

                What do you need to turn an idea into an actual product/service!?

                - Product design (UI/UX)
                - Website/app development
                - Digital marketing
                - Content writing
                - Management/Consultancy

                All 5 you get here in GenRes Agency, except the app development, for now. It&apos;s not costly.

                It&apos;s also fast.

                It is reliable.

                But you should not trust my words.

                You can create a custom package based on your needs and see our works.
